# Audio-controlled-robot
Sound-controlled mobile robot using FSK audio communication (800–1200 Hz). Implemented on a dsPIC with real-time DSP, chirp-based synchronization, and closed-loop motion control using encoder feedback. Project combines analog electronics, digital signal processing, embedded systems, and control theory.
